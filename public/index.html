   <h2><a href="https://fwupd.org/">The Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a></h2>
   <div class="entrytext">
    <p>
     In 2015, I decided updating firmware was too hard, and created
     <a href="https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd">fwupd</a> and the
     <a href="https://fwupd.org/">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>.
     Since then, 140 vendors have joined the service, and we've provided over a hundred million
     firmware updates.

    <p>
     In 2012, I decided installing applications was too hard, and created
     <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software">GNOME Software</a>.
     It's since been adopted by most distributions and is used by millions
     of people every day.

   <h2><a href="https://github.com/hughski">The Hughski ColorHug</a></h2>
   <div class="entrytext">
    <p>
     In 2011 I decided the world needed open source colorimeter hardware,
     and created the <a href="https://github.com/hughski">ColorHug</a>.
     We built over 3000 devices and have also added to the portfolio with ColorHug2 and ColorHugALS.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2020 we <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/colorhug-users/c/ePp9HyUUvms">shut down
     Hughski as a business</a> as the sensor used in the ColorHug became end of life and we had a
     baby to care for.

   <h2><a href="public/introduction-to-packagekit.pdf">PackageKit</a></h2>
   <div class="entrytext">
    <p>
     In <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2008/">2008</a> I decided installing
     packages was too hard and was not standardized between Linux distributions,
     so I created <a href="https://packagekit.freedesktop.org/">PackageKit</a>.
     It's now being used on millions of computers, and used by basically all
     distributions.

   <div class="entrytext">
    <p>
     In 2015 I got bored and wrote GNOME Power Manager; a session daemon for
     the GNOME desktop environment that makes it easy to manage your laptop
     or desktop system.
     It's now been merged into gnome-settings-daemon and is running on
     hundreds of millions of computers every day.
